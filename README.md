# Secert_Auction

Simple code which asks the user for their name, bid amount and adds them to a dictionary. 
the code also asks if there are any other bidders. If there are, then the console clears and asks for the next bidders name and bid. 

Once all the bids are in the console will print the winning bid (Highest bid).
